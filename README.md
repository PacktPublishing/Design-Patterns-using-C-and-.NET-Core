# Design Patterns Using C# and .NET Core [Video]
This is the code repository for [Design Patterns Using C# and .NET Core [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/design-patterns-using-c-and-net-core-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788625258), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. This course starts at the nuts-and-bolts level and shows you everything through to advanced patterns and features, going in-depth to give you the knowledge you need.

You will begin this course with an introduction to SOLID principles, which will introduce you to clean-code concepts and will elevate your skills. With this knowledge in your toolbox, you will be ready to move on to studying creational design patterns, patterns related to the creation of objects, such as Singleton, Factory, and Dependency Injection. You will then acquire more in-depth knowledge of one specific creational pattern, the Dependency Inversion pattern, which will teach you how to write highly extensible, maintainable, and testable code. Moving on, you will get your hands dirty with structural design patterns and you will complete this course by learning the last group of patterns: behavioral design patterns.

By the end of this course you will be very confident in implementing a new feature in C# and .NET Core because, every time you have a problem, the correct design pattern will spontaneously come to mind.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for C#, .Net professionals and students alike who would like to gain profound insights into design patterns via code walkthroughs and fast-paced knowledge acquisition through listening and watching. 
This course is also suitable for Java developers as C# and Java are very much alike, and the course focuses more on core principles and patterns rather than language specifics. In this case, a quick review of C# features is recommended before starting the course.
